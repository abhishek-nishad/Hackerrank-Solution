from heapq import *

            maxHeap = []
            minHeap = []

    The heapq library in Python provides only minHeap. So, in order to implement maxHeap, we multiply 
    every entry by -1 on every push and pop operation.

            ADD ELEMENTS : heappush(maxHeap, -(input-value))
                         : heappush(minHeap, input-value)

            REMOVE ELEMENT : -heappop(maxHeap)
                           : heappop(minHeap)

            TOP ELEMENT : -maxHeap[0] or minHeap[0]
